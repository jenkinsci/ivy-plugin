/**
 * Listens to the build execution of {@link IvyBuild},
 * and normally records some information and exposes these
 * in {@link IvyBuild} later.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link IvyReporter} is first instantiated on the master.
 * Then during the build, it is serialized and sent over into
 * the Ant process by serialization. Reporters will then receive
 * event callbacks as Ant build events. Those event callbacks
 * are the ones that take {@link IvyBuildProxy}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Once the Ant build completes normally or abnormally, the reporters
 * will be sent back to the master by serialization again, then
 * have its {@link #end(IvyBuild, Launcher, BuildListener)} method invoked.
 * This is a good opportunity to perform the post-build action.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is the {@link IvyBuild} equivalent of {@link BuildStep}. Instances
 * of {@link IvyReporter}s are persisted with {@link IvyModule}/{@link IvyModuleSet},
 * possibly with configuration specific to that job.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Callback Firing Sequence</h2>
 * <p>
 * The callback methods are invoked in the following order:
 *
 * <pre>
 * SEQUENCE := preBuild MODULE* postBuild end
 * MODULE   := enterModule leaveModule
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When an error happens, the call sequence could be terminated at any point
 * and no further callback methods may be invoked.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Action</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link IvyReporter} can {@link IvyBuild#addAction(Action) contribute}
 * {@link Action} to {@link IvyBuild} so that the report can be displayed
 * in the web UI.
 *
 * <p>
 * Such action can also implement {@link AggregatableAction} if it further
 * wishes to contribute a separate action to {@link IvyModuleSetBuild}.
 * This mechanism is usually used to provide aggregated report for all the
 * module builds.
